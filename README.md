# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass

Hi, It's me (Hoang Le) again. And I want to say this repository contains the code of the [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/).

In this course I study many about algorithms and data structures: Big O notation, Recursion, I implement popular searching algorithms, linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs, and cover Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm. The course also includes an entire section devoted to Dynamic Programming.
